### General
From this repository, you will find all the necessary components that you may find interesting and helpful for your own stuff from our paper.

However, codes provided here are not directly executable, e.g., you would not be able to download and run on your machine.
This is because, the [EmoPain](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7173007/) data is not publicly available, but downloadable upon application.
In the end, the testing data is held by the EmoPain developer.
